# FRMasking Adverserial Training
---
Fixed Randomized Masking (FRMasking) is a novel adverserial training technique i'm proposing as an alternative to conventional adverserial training techniques which are time consuming and resource intensive. 

FRMasking.ipynb sequentially executes the steps required to adverserially train a VGG16 model on CIFAR10 data using PGD & FRMasking
